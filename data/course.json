  "course_title": "Major Authors: John Milton",
  "course_description": "In 1667, John Milton published what he intended both as the crowning achievement of a poetic career and a justification of God's ways to man: an epic poem which retold and reimagined the Biblical story of creation, temptation, and original sin. Even in a hostile political climate, _Paradise Lost_ was almost immediately recognized as a classic, and one fate of a classic is to be rewritten, both by admirers and by antagonists. In this seminar, we will read _Paradise Lost_ alongside works of 20th century fantasy and science fiction which rethink both Milton's text and its source.\n\nStudents should come to the seminar having read _Paradise Lost_ straight through at least once; this can be accomplished by taking the IAP subject, _Reading_ _Paradise Lost_ (21L.995), or independently. Twentieth century authors will include C. S. Lewis (_Perelandra_, _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_) and Philip Pullman (_His Dark Materials_), as well as assorted criticism. Each week, one class meeting will focus on Milton, and the other on one of the modern novels.\n",
